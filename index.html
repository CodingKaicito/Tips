<h2>Mental:</h2>
<h3>Discipline:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Go outside your comfort zone.</li>
      <li>Perfection is a lack of discipline</li>
      <li>You have to be okay with things not working out.</li>
      <li>You cannot keep overthinking; you putting negative energy towards whatever it is before it even happens is you tending to the face of it possibly happening, more than the actual possibility of something positive happening.</li>
    </ul>

  <p><strong>Leone, C. (2016). Self Discipline Mindset. Createspace Independent Publishing Platform.:</strong></p>
  <p>Do Not Wait to Feel like It, Dump All Your Excuses:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use Mantras - "Mantra refers to a positive suggestion or chant that you create and say repeatedly. When you say something frequently, it influences your mind and thinking pattern thus shaping it in that direction. ... Create a mantra related to self-discipline and a goal that you want to achieve and then chant this mantra day in and day out until you feel that whatever you say is the ultimate truth.
        ... One way of making yourself to remember to say the mantra is to have it printed and a copy placed strategically at literally everywhere you can see it."</li>
      <li>Dump Your Habit of Making Excuses - "You need to discard your unhealthy behavior of making excuses for delaying a task. ... The reason you've been struggling over the years to achieve your goals is probably because you make excuses for not starting. ... If you come up with an excuse, 'I won't go out for a jog now because it's too cold outside', then you need to be honest with yourself and state the real reason of not jogging.
          Tell yourself, 'I am not going jogging because I am extremely lazy and lack the will to do something healthy.' Ouch! Did that sting?
         Of course, it did. That's what honesty does. It pinches you and makes you realize your wrongs."</li>
    </ul>
  
  <p>Take Action with your Action Plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make Your Action Plan - "You can create a tabular action plan [data presented in tables] or use Excel or MS Word to make one. Find out what steps you need to carry out and in what order they must be performed to do what needs to be done to achieve a certain goal. Make sure to make important columns or sections, such as 'action to be taken', 'time to start the task', 'potential problems you face', 'strategies you can adopt for overcoming your issues', and 'progress report.'
         Next, you need to fill the columns with appropriate content."</li>
      <li>Prepare Yourself to Take Some Action - "If the action plan is not too detailed such that it has the specifics on even the smallest of details, you can get someone to help you come up with ideas for taking action. Get as many ideas on how to take action then decide on the most viable approach. From then on, go on to set a start time i.e. when you want to do whatever it is you need to do."</li>
      <li>Anticipate Potential Issues and Find Strategies to Fix Them - "You need to consider any potential problem(s) that you are likely to face when working on your action plan and devise [plan] strategies that will help you to overcome such problems. For instance, if you worry you'll switch off the alarm when it rings at 5am and drift off to sleep again, then a potential problem could be 'I will probably fall asleep.' Then identify any workable solution that could help you tackle this issue.
         For instance, you could ask your partner or your roommate to wake you up and ensure that you don't go back to sleep."</li>
      <li>Track Your Progress, Review Your Plan and Make Necessary Changes to It - "You cannot know how well you are doing if you don’t track your progress. This means that you won’t be able to tell whether you are really following your action plan. Therefore, it is important that you make the necessary plans on how to know how well you are performing with regards to following your action plan.
         For instance, if you wanted to lose weight (say 15 pounds in two months), you will need to determine how often you will weigh yourself to determine your progress. If you notice any flaws in your action plan, this is the best time to fix that. This will increase your chances of following the plan and nurturing your self-discipline."</li>
      <li>Reframe the Mistakes You Make - "You are likely to make a few mistakes, or maybe more in the beginning. But, that’s completely fine. You must not put yourself down, or practice self-hate or self-criticism upon making a mistake.
        You just need to get up, motivate yourself and continue pushing. ... When you discover your mistake, simply take some time to reflect on the mistake as objectively as possible and avoid blaming yourself or criticizing yourself for any wrongdoing. You want to encourage yourself to action not put yourself down for your flaws.
         Reflect on the positives and the benefits that will come with nurturing self-discipline. This will give you a glimpse of the bigger picture hence increasing your chances of feeling motivated to action as opposed to feeling bad for making mistakes."</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Work on Overcoming Temptations:</p>
  <p>"As you work towards building self-discipline, you should definitely anticipate facing many ‘temptations’. You shouldn’t expect to move from one end to the other end of the spectrum instantly without facing any temptations to go back to the habits that you are so much used to. Here are a few strategies on how to overcome temptations and stay committed to your goal."</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detach Yourself from the Attractions - "A good tactic to overcome your temptations is to detach yourself from whatever tempts and excites you. For instance, if you are disciplining yourself to stop smoking, you could stop meeting your smoking buddies (people with whom you smoke frequently) for awhile until you have gained complete restraint, or you could stop visiting the spots where you smoked frequently."</li>
      <li>"Mostly, what lures you into giving in to a temptation is the immediate gratification you experience. Unfortunately, the immediate gratification only lasts for a short period and instead leaves you feeling guilty. A useful tactic to overcome your temptations is to always weigh immediate gratification against the long-term consequences of giving in to your temptation.
         For instance, smoking may give you a sense of satisfaction for a few moments, but the long-term consequences of this habit are severe and include fatal diseases such as lung cancer. One great way of overcoming immediate gratifications is to think about the worst-case scenario for giving in to the temptations."</li>
      <li>Distract Yourself - "Giving too much thought to whatever is tempting you can make it pretty hard for you to overcome it. Don’t think too much about how much you are missing out when you don’t succumb to your temptations. Instead, you need to distract yourself as a way of ensuring you don’t put too much focus on the temptation and what you are missing.
         Research shows that doing something enjoyable or anything that keeps your mind occupied can help you fight your temptations easily."</li>
      <li>Motivate Yourself - "You need to motivate yourself every step of the way. For instance, whenever you accomplish a certain goal that helps you become more disciplined; you should praise and reward yourself. Make sure that the reward isn’t something you are trying to resist, but is something that encourages you to stay dedicated to your goal."</li>
      </ul>

<div id="Glow-Up-Tips">

<h1><u>Glow-Up Tips</u></h1>
<h2>Body:</h2>
<h3>Use a sugar scrub:</h3>
  <p> A sugar scrub is a skin care product used after washing the body to exfoliate the skin, remove dead skin cells, and promote skin renewal. It creates smoother, softer, and brighter skin. It can even help your skin tone look more even.
    It also helps you absorb moisturizer better.
  </p>

  <p>Take into consideration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most of the dust (90%) in your home is dead skin cells since your whole body is covered with them.</li>
      <li>Using natural scrubs without chemicals is the healthiest alternative for your skin.</li>
      <li>Salt scrubs from the Dead Sea contain minerals that further help the skin.</li>
      <li>Many natural scrubs have anti-bacterial properties that may help with acne.</li>
      <li>Scrubs containing coffee grounds not only exfoliate, the caffeine also helps reduce puffiness and inflammation.</li>
      <li> Over-exfoliating may cause irritation so not only the type of scrub is important but also how it is applied.</li>
      <li>Exfoliating more than 2-3 times per week is not only irritating but may strip skin of natural oils and lead to breakouts.</li>
    </ul>

<br>
    
<h2>Face:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid rubbing your eyes or sleeping on your face, which can damage both your eyebrows and eyelashes.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

<h3>Acne:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t try to pop your pimple - Avoid touching or picking at your face.</li>
      <li>Skip home remedies, like toothpaste, hydrogen peroxide, and rubbing alcohol.</li>
      <li>Try to touch your face less.</li>
      <li>Eat better (<a href="#Diet">Diet Here)</a></li>
    </ul>

<br>

<h3>Honey:</h3>
  <p>Honey has intensive hydrating properties, promoting elasticity and firmness. It exfoliates dry skin gently.</p>
  <p>Take into consideration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most moisturizers have lots of synthetic chemical products inside them, which surely isn't very healthy. While honey is all-natural.</li>
      <li>Honey contains enzymes that allow moisture to get deep in the skin, bringing much-needed hydration to the deeper layers.</li>
      <li>Leave honey on the face for about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ul>

<br>

<h3>Jawline:</h3>
  <p><strong>Exercises:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Jaw Clenches: Clench your jaw muscles tightly for a few seconds and then release. Repeat this several times a day to strengthen your jawline.</li>
      <li>Neck Resistance: Place your hand on your forehead and push your head against your hand without moving your neck.</li>
      <li>Zygopulling: Take your thumbs and put them in the very edge part of your palate in between your teeth and your cheeks just behind your cheekbones. Then massage upwards and outwards. This is used to loosen up your fascia and get you ready for thumbpulling.</li>
      <li>Chintucking: Stand/Sit up nice and straight against something behind you like a chair or a wall. Push your shoulders out and get your neck straight and have every part of your body touching the wall/chair other than your heels. Your heels should be slightly pushed forward.
         Now, dont move your neck, just hinge it. Hinge your chin towards your neck and give yourself as many double chins as possible.</li>
      <li>Thumbpulling: Put your hands spread apart with your thumbs sticking out and put your thumbs behind your lateral incisors. Not touching your teeth, just on your palate. Then push up and outwards with your thumbs. Like this:</li>
      <img src="thumb.jpeg" style="width: 75%;">
      <li>THE ULTIMATE: Do Zygopulling and then combine Chintucking and Thumbpulling together. Here's the key when doing Chintucking x Thumbpulling, resist downwards with your chin and at the same time push upwards and outwards with your thumbs. Hold for 30 seconds once every hour of the day if you can. Like this:</li>
      <img src="chin x thumb.jpeg" style="width: 75%;">
    </ul>

<br>

  <p><strong>Gum:</strong></p>
  <p>It's important to take into consideration that even during breaks from chewing, your jaw muscles will still receive some level of stimulation from everyday activities. Therefore, you're unlikely to experience a significant loss of gains during these periods of rest. I suggest having 1-2 month breaks between your chewing periods to ensure the best muscle recovery and ongoing progress.</p>

  <p>The skin around your eyelids is delicate and requires special care to maintain its health and appearance.</p>
  <p>Hydration:</p>
  <p>Keeping your eyelid skin hydrated is very important. Use lightweight, hydrating eye creams that provide moisture without causing puffiness. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and peptides, which can help maintain skin elasticity and smoothness.</p>
  <p>Protection:</p>
  <p>The skin around the eyes is thinner and more prone to damage from environmental factors. Always apply sun protection around the eye area to prevent UV damage. Consider wearing sunglasses to shield your eyes from harmful rays and prevent squinting.</p>
  <p>Anti-Aging Treatments:</p>
  <p>To fight signs of aging, consider products that contain retinol or peptides. These ingredients can help reduce fine lines and wrinkles, keeping your eyelid skin looking youthful and vibrant.</p>

  <p>Positive: A slight positive tilt is ideal for men's eyebrows. If your eyebrows lack this, grow them out and reshape them.</p>
  <p> Neutral: A neutral tilt isn't a deal-breaker. You can still grow the top area and reshape them.</p>
  <p>Negative: This is the worst tilt, often due to a droopy end. Shave the arch and droopy part.</p>

<br>

  <p><strong>Eyebrow Maintenance:</strong></p>
  <p>Shave your eyebrows twice a month to keep them sharp and clean, removing any loose hairs around them. Use a combination of plucking and an eyebrow razor for the best results.</p>
  <p>Plucking vs. Eyebrow Razor:</p>
  <p>Plucking: Offers precision and longer-lasting results since hairs are removed from the root but can be painful and time-consuming.</p>
  <p>Eyebrow Razor: Faster and less painful, good for quick touch-ups, but hair grows back faster and requires more skill for precision.</p>

<h2>Hair:</h2>
<h3>Follow this step-by-step effective shampoo usage method:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Wet your hair with warm, or cool water (preferably cool).</li>
      <li>Apply a quarter-sized amount of shampoo to your hands.</li>
      <li>Rub your hands together to distribute the shampoo.</li>
      <li>Evenly spread the shampoo across the front, middle, back, and sides of your hair. (And above the hairline on your neck)</li>
      <li>Gently massage your scalp with your fingers in all areas.</li>
      <li>Repeat if your scalp is greasy.</li>
      <li>Rinse the shampoo thoroughly with water.</li>
    </ol>

<br>

<h3>Shampoo and Conditioner for straight hair:</h3>
  <p>A modest amount of conditioner is preferred, approximately the same size as a dime or nickel, adjusting based on hair length. Focus on applying the conditioner to the mid-length parts of your hair. Avoid directly applying conditioner to the roots, as this can result in an oily scalp and weigh down your hair.
    Also, consider your hair's dryness when determining the appropriate amount of conditioner to use. If your hair feels dry or brittle, you may benefit from applying a bit more conditioner to provide additional moisture and nourishment.</p>
  <p>Overdoing it: Shampooing daily or more than once every other day.</p>
  <p>Frequency: Shampoo every other day or every two to three days.</p>

<br>

<br>

<h3>Coconut Oil:</h3>
  <p>Benefits: Nourishes and strengthens hair, reducing protein loss and enhancing shaft penetration.</p>

  <p>How to Use: Use as a pre-shampoo treatment, massaging onto scalp and hair, leaving for at least 30 minutes before washing.</p>

  <p>Memory Palace Method: To remember something, think of what it looks like and what it feels like.</p>
  <p>Active Recall: The process of retrieving information from memory. Ex: Instead of using Quizlet to study for a Spanish exam, write down all the words you know, and then look at the Quizlet and see what you missed/got wrong. When doing active recall, ask yourself, are you truly challenging your brain?</p>
  <p>Space Repetition: Review new information at increasing intervals. Say, after 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, etc.</p>

<br>

<h2>Studying:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use ChatGPT to make questions for you.</li>
      <li>Study your past reviews/exams on that unit.</li>
      <li>Feynman Technique: Ask a friend, imaginable person, or a stuffed animal questions and let them answer/answer for them. Record yourself doing this and play it back so you put that thought in your brain. Ex: the Quadratic Formula 😭😭. 
           You say it to a stuffed animal and then listen to yourself saying it to your stuffed animal. You should start remembering it.</li>
      <li>Make quizlet and class notes every day and have past papers every other day.</li>
      <li>Do spaced repetition. Ex:</li>
    </ul>
